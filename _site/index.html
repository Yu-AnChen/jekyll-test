<p>t-CyCIF is a method for highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology">formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded</a>
(FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for
histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. A related CyCIF method
is used to image cells grown in culture (see publications). t-CyCIF generates up
to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional
low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and
then assembled into a high dimensional representation.</p>

<p>t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with
super-resolution imaging. We have shown that t-CyCIF can be used to quantify
signal transduction cascades, measure the levels of tumor antigens and determine
immunophenotypes using immune cell lineage markers. The key features of t-CyCIF
are that it is simple to implement on existing microscopes, it requires no
special or proprietary reagents and antibodies can be combined as needed to
investigate specific questions.</p>

<h3 id="the-t-cycif-process">The t-CyCIF Process</h3>

<p>In t-CyCIF, ~5 µm thick are cut from FFPE blocks, the standard in most
histopathology services, followed by dewaxing and antigen retrieval in the usual
manner; to reduce auto-fluorescence a cycle of “pre-staining” is performed.
Subsequent t-CyCIF cycles each involve four steps (Figure 1): (i)
immuno-staining with antibodies against protein antigens (three antigens per
cycle in the implementation described here) (ii) staining with a DNA dye
(commonly Hoechst 33342) to mark nuclei and facilitate image registration across
cycles (iii) four-channel imaging at low and high magnifications (iv)
fluorophore bleaching followed by a wash step and then another round of
immuno-staining. The signal-to-noise ratio often increases with cycle number.
When no more t-CyCIF cycles are to be performed, the specimen is stained with
H&amp;E to enable conventional histopathology review. Individual image panels are
stitched together and registered across cycles followed by image processing and
segmentation to identify cells and other structures.</p>

<h3 id="imaging">Imaging</h3>

<p>Imaging of t-CyCIF specimens can be performed on a variety of fluorescent
microscopes each of which represent a different tradeoff between data
acquisition time, image resolution and sensitivity (Figure 2). Specimens several
square centimeters in area are often examined at a resolution of ~1 µm on slide
scanners, but high resolution image is obtained using confocal or structured
illumination microscopes.</p>

<h3 id="antibodies-for-tissue-based-cycif">Antibodies for tissue-based CyCIF</h3>

<p>In the first cycle of t-CyCIF is possible to use indirect immunofluorescence and
secondary antibodies. In all other cycles antibodies are directly conjugated to
fluorophores, typically Alexa 488, 555 or 647. As an alternative to chemical
coupling we have tested the Zenon™ antibody labelling method from ThermoFisher
in which isotype-specific Fab fragments pre-labelled with fluorophores are bound
to primary antibodies to create immune complexes; the immune complexes are then
incubated with tissue samples. This method is effective with some but not all
primary antibodies.</p>

<p>To date, we have tested commercial antibodies against ~200 proteins for their
compatibility with t-CyCIF. These antibodies include lineage makers,
cytoskeletal proteins, cell cycle regulators, the phosphorylated forms of
signaling proteins and kinases, transcription factors, markers of cell state
including quiescence, senescence, apoptosis, stress, etc.
(see <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/data/CyCIF-Tested-Antibodies-May2018.xlsx">Table 1</a>). Currently we rely
exclusively on commercial antibodies that have previously been validated using
immuno-histochemistry (IHC) or conventional immunofluorescence. We compare
staining by t-CyCIF and what has previously been reported for IHC staining
(Figure 3) We also compare directly antibodies against the same antigen by using
different antibodies in different channels; this enables pixel-level comparison
of the same cells (Figure 4).</p>

<p>Efforts to date do not constitute a sufficient level of testing or validation
for clinical studies and patterns of staining described in this site or in our
publications should therefore be considered illustrative of the t-CyCIF approach
rather than definitive descriptions. We are currently assembling an OMERO
(https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/) database of matched t-CyCIF and IHC
images across multiple tissues and knockdown cell lines to further advance
antibody validation. This date will be available near the end of 2018.</p>

<h3 id="image-processing-and-data-analysis">Image processing and data analysis</h3>

<p>Image processing and data analysis are demanding in the case of high-plex tissue
images; we use software tools developed by others supplemented by a growing
number of specialized methods (code can be found
at <a href="https://github.com/sorgerlab/cycif/">our GitHub repository</a>. Once cells are
segmented and turned into intensity information, tools such as t-SNE can be used
in much the same way as with mass cytometry and other high-dimensional data
(Figure 5).</p>
